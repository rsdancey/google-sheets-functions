# Configuration Migration to Figment

## Summary

Successfully migrated the configuration system from a custom TOML parser to the Figment crate.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Simplified Configuration Loading**
- **Before**: Manual TOML parsing with complex Windows path preprocessing using regex
- **After**: Clean Figment-based configuration loading with built-in TOML support

### 2. **Environment Variable Handling**
- **Before**: Complex Figment environment variable mapping (which was causing compilation errors)
- **After**: Simple manual environment variable override (maintaining the same functionality as the original)

### 3. **Windows Path Handling**
- **Before**: Complex regex-based preprocessing to handle Windows backslash escaping
- **After**: Simplified path normalization that works cross-platform

### 4. **Code Reduction**
- **Before**: ~330 lines of complex path handling and configuration logic
- **After**: ~200 lines of clean, maintainable code

### 5. **Test Coverage**
- Maintained all existing test functionality
- Added new tests for the simplified configuration system
- All tests pass successfully

## Key Benefits

1. **Maintainability**: Much simpler and easier to understand code
2. **Reliability**: Uses well-tested Figment crate instead of custom regex parsing
3. **Cross-platform**: Better handling of different operating systems
4. **Performance**: Reduced complexity means faster configuration loading

## Files Changed

- `config.rs` â†’ `config.rs.old` (preserved the old version)
- Created new `config.rs` with Figment-based implementation

## API Compatibility

The new configuration maintains the same public API:
- `Config::load()` works exactly the same
- All struct fields remain identical
- Environment variables work the same way
- Configuration validation is preserved

## Testing

All tests pass:
- `test_default_config`
- `test_normalize_windows_path`
- `test_config_validation`
- `test_environment_variable_override`
- `test_is_windows_path`

The project builds successfully with no warnings or errors.
